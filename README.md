  <h2>------------Important Note--------------
    
 Two members of our MachineLearners team, Abhirup Basak and Deep Sarkar are not able to complete the course
'Enterprise Grade A.I.' because of a visibility glitch with the Topic "Add skills to your Watson Assistant".
Upon Opening the slides of that topic they find a white screen with no navigative or interactive buttons and therefore are unable to complete it,
resulting them unable to access the last test in the third module even though they completed all their other topics in the course and 
completed the test from module 1 and 2.
    We had contacted the support several times but they were unable to provide a solution
